##Â Design Pattern

The router set the presenter with the initial app status, it takes this from the url.
The presenter serialize those url params and set them nicely.
The presenter trigger change events.
The mediator is listening to those events and call the views to perform required changes.

## Check it out
/#loss/9/terrain/

On the console:
app.views.lossTimeline.animate();
app.views.lossTimeline.stopAnimation();
app.presenter.getLayer('forest').active = true;
app.presenter.spread();
app.presenter.get('map').zoom = 3;
app.presenter.spread();

## Presenter and events

When updating presenter model, you need to call presenter.spread() to trigger events.

## Canvas performance

Caching processed canvas image data makes the render smother but will break eventually of lack of memory. Tested with underscore memoize.

Another ideas: 
  - We could proccess those filters on the server and cache them.
  - Use workers to proccess just some images on the background. For example those for the timeline, so when the user plays the animation, it could be already loaded. (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/)
